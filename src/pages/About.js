                Hello! My name is Ronald Ossai and I enjoy creating things that live on Computers. 
                My interest in technology started at a very young age. I started learning how to code in 2015 when I decided to try making a 2d football game with 
                python and pygame. It was nothing novel and it was terminal based but it was the catalyst to the life i currently call 
                my reality.
              </p>
              <p className="text-dark mb-4">
                Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at Allianz Insurance as a Software Developer, 
                I have been able to attend a top university, the University of Sussex, where I studied Computer Science and Artifical Intelligence. 
                I have had the privilege of working at a huge corporation, and several student-led projects. My main focus these days 
                is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences.
